**About**

This is what the ForeverGamess site (Version 17 and above) is based on. This is powered by a GitHub Repository named Native. Native includes a pre-coded template, that I have modified to work well with ForeverGamess. 

It uses some popular games usually selected by Unblocked Games sites for online HTML gaming.

**DISCLAIMER**

**DO NOT USE FOREVERGAMESS IN AN EDUCATIONAL OR WORK ENVIRONMENT IF YOU AREN'T PERMITTED TO DO SO. FOREVERGAMESS IS INTENDED FOR LOWER-END HOME COMPUTERS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RUN GAMES NATIVELY! WE GIVE FULL CREDIT TO THE CREATOR AND DEV. OF NATIVE! WE DID NOT CREATE THIS REPO OR THE GAMES CONTAINED!**
